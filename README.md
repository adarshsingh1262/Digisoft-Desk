# Digisoft360 Help Desk

A multi-tenant customer support platform: ticketing, SLA, automation, knowledge base,
omnichannel and AI assistance.

**Status: Phases 1–5 implemented.** Authentication, RBAC, organizations, users,
departments, teams, contacts, accounts, the full ticketing core — conversations,
internal comments, attachments, history, the agent workspace — the operations layer —
activities, assignment rules, an automation engine with escalations, SLA with business
hours and a background sweep, blueprint workflows — and self-service: a branded help
center per organization with a knowledge base, web forms, customer accounts, "my
requests" and a moderated community — and omnichannel: email in and out with real
threading, live chat, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, Telegram and telephony adapters,
signed outbound webhooks and API keys. AI and analytics are not built yet, and the UI
does not pretend otherwise.

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # set the two JWT secrets
docker compose --profile local-db up --build
```

Then open http://localhost:3000. Full instructions in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, TanStack Query, Zustand, React Hook Form + Zod |
| Backend | Node.js + NestJS 11, REST `/api/v1`, Socket.IO |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 via Prisma 6 |
| Background work | BullMQ on Redis, run by a separate worker process |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose for development; S3-compatible object storage |

## Layout

```
apps/api       NestJS API and Socket.IO gateway
apps/worker    BullMQ consumers (email, notifications, automation, SLA sweep, channel sends, webhooks)
apps/web       Next.js frontend
packages/engine  Rule evaluation, actions, business-hours SLA math, assignment, blueprints
packages/channels Channel adapters (verify, parse, send) and credential encryption
packages/db    Prisma schema, migrations, seed, tenant-isolation extension
packages/shared  Zod schemas and types shared by the frontend and backend
```

## What is built

- **Multi-tenancy** enforced in the data layer, not in callers: a Prisma client
  extension injects `organizationId` into every query and cross-tenant access returns
  404 rather than 403, so record ids stay unenumerable.
- **Authentication** with Argon2id, short-lived access tokens, and refresh-token
  rotation with reuse detection that revokes the whole session family.
- **RBAC** over a permission catalogue, with five seeded system roles and support for
  custom ones. Permissions are re-resolved per request (Redis-cached), so revoking a
  role takes effect immediately.
- **Organizations, users, departments, teams, contacts, accounts** — full CRUD with
  validation, authorization, audit history and soft deletes.
- **Ticketing** with per-organization sequential numbering allocated inside the
  creation transaction, configurable statuses and priorities (behaviour comes from
  flags, never from a name), assignment, tags, merge, linking and following.
- **Conversations** stored one row per message, with customer replies and internal
  comments as distinct types. Internal comments are filtered out in the database query
  for non-agents and are unmistakable in the UI.
- **Attachments** with a MIME allowlist, size cap and filename sanitisation; metadata in
  PostgreSQL and bytes in storage, behind two real providers (local filesystem, or any
  S3-compatible bucket with signed URLs). Every download is re-authorised.
- **Record-level ticket access**: `ticket.read.all` sees the whole queue; without it an
  agent sees only their assignments, their departments and tickets they follow.
- **Agent workspace**: three-pane queue / conversation / properties layout with saved
  views, filters, search, quick actions and a history timeline.
- **Activities**: tasks, calls and events attached to tickets, contacts and accounts.
- **Assignment rules**: ordered, condition-driven routing to a specific agent, a
  department queue, round-robin, or the least-loaded agent.
- **Automation engine**: trigger + conditions + ordered actions, with every evaluation
  recorded. Escalations are the same rules on the SLA triggers.
- **SLA**: per-priority first-response and resolution targets on a business-hours
  calendar with holidays; the clock pauses in on-hold statuses and a worker sweep raises
  warnings and breaches exactly once.
- **Blueprints**: configurable state machines with required fields and role
  restrictions; a governed ticket can only move along its allowed transitions.
- **Help center**: one customer-facing site per organization at `/help/<slug>`, with its
  own branding and switches for public browsing, sign-up, request submission, the
  knowledge base and the community. Settings take effect immediately.
- **Knowledge base**: categories and Markdown articles with draft/published states and
  three visibility levels, slugs derived from titles, portal search that ranks title
  matches first, view counts and "was this helpful" feedback the author can read.
- **Web forms**: a field builder whose submissions become tickets — routed, given an SLA
  and put through automation like any other ticket — with a honeypot and rate limiting
  instead of a third-party captcha.
- **Customer portal**: customers sign up (reusing the contact an agent already has for
  that address), raise requests, reply with attachments, reopen a resolved request by
  replying, and close their own. They never see an internal comment, and never another
  customer's request.
- **Community**: categories, topics, replies, one-vote-per-person upvotes, accepted
  answers, and an optional moderation queue agents work from the agent app.
- **Email as a real channel**: signed inbound webhooks (generic, Mailgun, Postmark) that
  become tickets — contact resolved, attachments stored, quoted history trimmed,
  auto-replies ignored — and outbound replies carrying `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To` and
  `References`, so the customer's answer threads back onto the same ticket.
- **Live chat** with its own visitor socket: the conversation is a ticket from the first
  line, agents pick it up from a chat inbox, and the reply reaches the widget instantly.
- **Messaging and telephony adapters**: WhatsApp Cloud, Messenger, Instagram, Telegram
  and Twilio, each verifying the provider's real signature scheme; a call arrives as a
  logged call activity with its recording.
- **Idempotent ingestion**: every delivery is stored before it is interpreted and keyed
  by the provider's message id, so a redelivery changes nothing and a parser bug leaves
  the evidence behind.
- **Outbound webhooks** with per-endpoint signing keys, HMAC signatures over
  `timestamp.body`, retries with backoff, a delivery log and replay.
- **API keys** backed by their own service user and role, so an integration is
  authorised, audited and attributed exactly like a person, and revoking one closes
  every path at once.
- **Background jobs and realtime**: a worker that sends email, runs automation and
  sweeps SLAs, and an authenticated Socket.IO gateway whose ticket events reach only
  the sockets entitled to that ticket.
