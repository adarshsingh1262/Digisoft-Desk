# Digisoft360 Help Desk — Architecture

> Status: **Phases 1–5 implemented.** Sections describing later phases are marked as planned.

## 1. Final architecture

Two separate deployable applications plus a worker process, sharing one PostgreSQL and one Redis.

```

**Key decisions**

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Backend framework | NestJS (Node.js + TypeScript) | §3/§50 of the spec describe NestJS modules; NestJS *is* a Node.js framework, so "use Node.js" is satisfied. DI + module boundaries give us the modular monolith of §61. |
| Architecture style | Modular monolith, worker split out as a process | §17/§61. One codebase, hard module boundaries, no microservices. |
| ORM | Prisma | §48/§49 mandate Prisma migrations and parameterised queries. |
| API transport | REST `/api/v1` + Socket.IO | §43/§47. |
| Frontend | Next.js App Router (TypeScript) | §34 SEO for the Help Center; server components for public pages. |
| Repo layout | Single repo, pnpm workspaces | Shared TS types between FE/BE without publishing packages. Frontend and backend stay independently deployable. |
| Tenancy | Shared database, shared schema, `organizationId` column + enforced scoping layer | §7. Simplest correct model at this scale; row-level enforcement lives in a Prisma extension, not in controllers. |
| Auth | JWT access token (short-lived) + refresh token rotation in HTTP-only cookie | §9. |
| Config | `@nestjs/config` + Zod-validated env schema, fail-fast at boot | §56. |

**Explicitly deferred (architecture prepared, not implemented in Phase 1):** SLA timers, automation engine, AI, channels beyond email, community, pgvector/RAG, OpenSearch.

## 2. Repository structure

pnpm workspace. The frontend and backend stay independently deployable; only types and
Zod schemas are shared, through a package with no Nest or React dependency.

```

**Why `packages/db` owns Prisma:** the API and the worker both need the generated
client. Keeping the schema, migrations and generated client in one package means one
schema, one client and one migration history rather than two that can drift.

## 3. Multi-tenancy architecture

Model: **shared database, shared schema, tenant discriminator**.

1. Every tenant-owned table carries `organizationId` with a FK to `Organization` and an index (usually a composite index leading with `organizationId`).
2. `AsyncLocalStorage`-based `TenantContext` is populated by `TenantContextInterceptor` from the *verified JWT claim* — never from a header, query param or body (§66).
3. `PrismaService` installs a **client extension** that, for every model in the tenant-model registry:
   - injects `organizationId` into `where` on `findMany/findFirst/updateMany/deleteMany/count/aggregate`,
   - injects `organizationId` into `data` on `create/createMany`,
   - rejects `findUnique`/`update`/`delete` results whose `organizationId` mismatches (throws `TenantIsolationError` → 404, never 403, so IDs are not enumerable).
4. Escape hatch: `prisma.$unscoped()` — used only by platform-level code (auth login lookup by email, webhook ingestion before tenant resolution) and grep-auditable.
5. Cross-cutting resources (BullMQ jobs, S3 keys, Socket.IO rooms, cache keys) are all namespaced by `organizationId`: `org:{id}:...`.
6. Tests: a dedicated tenant-isolation suite seeds two orgs and asserts every list/detail/update/delete endpoint returns 404 across the boundary.

Customers (contacts) authenticate into the same org but with role `CUSTOMER`; they are additionally scoped to *their own* tickets by a `RequesterScope` applied in the tickets service.

## 4. Authentication & RBAC architecture

**Authentication**
- Passwords: Argon2id.
- Login → `{ accessToken (JWT, 15 min, in memory/response body), refreshToken (opaque, 30 d, HTTP-only + Secure + SameSite=Lax cookie) }`.
- Refresh tokens are stored hashed in `RefreshToken` with `familyId`; rotation on every use, and reuse of a consumed token revokes the whole family (replay detection).
- Access token claims: `sub` (userId), `org` (organizationId), `role`, `perms` (permission-key array), `typ`.
- Email verification and password reset use single-use hashed tokens in `VerificationToken` with TTL.
- Logout revokes the refresh family and clears the cookie.
- Socket.IO handshake authenticates with the access token, then resolves the user's
  permissions and departments to decide room membership: `org:{orgId}`,
  `org:{orgId}:user:{userId}`, one room per department, and `org:{orgId}:tickets:all`
  only for users holding `ticket.read.all`. Ticket events are addressed to those rooms,
  so the socket layer cannot leak a ticket the API would refuse. No global broadcasts (§43).

**Authorization**
- `PermissionsGuard` (global) + `@RequirePermissions('ticket.update')`. Public routes opt out with `@Public()`.
- Permissions are string keys `resource.action` seeded per organization; roles are rows (`Role` → `RolePermission`), so custom roles and Light Agent (§8) drop in with no code change.
- System roles seeded per org: `SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `AGENT`, `LIGHT_AGENT`, `CUSTOMER`.
- Second layer beyond permissions: **record-level policies** in services (e.g. an agent with `ticket.read` still only sees tickets in their departments unless they hold `ticket.read.all`).
- Rate limiting: `@nestjs/throttler` with a default bucket and a stricter `auth`
  bucket on login, registration, password reset and invite resends. Counters live in
  process memory today, so limits apply per API instance; moving them to Redis is
  required before running more than one instance (tracked in DEPLOYMENT.md).

## 5. Docker development architecture

`docker compose --profile local-db up --build` starts `postgres:16`, `redis:7`,
`minio` (S3-compatible), `mailhog` (SMTP capture), `api`, `worker` and `web`.

- The `api` service runs `prisma migrate deploy` before starting. In production this belongs in a separate release job (see DEPLOYMENT.md) so two starting instances cannot migrate concurrently.
- `pnpm db:seed` creates a demo organization with the system roles, permission
  catalogue, two departments, an admin and an agent.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` uses multi-stage builds (distroless runtime), no bind mounts, external managed Postgres/Redis/S3, and Nginx in front.
- The local `postgres` service sits behind the `local-db` compose profile: supply a
  managed `DATABASE_URL` and run `docker compose up` without the profile to skip it.

## 5b. The operations engine

`packages/engine` is pure logic with a small dependency contract (`prisma`, `redis`,
`emailQueue`, `log`). Both hosts satisfy it with an **unscoped** Prisma client, so every
engine query names `organizationId` explicitly — the worker has no request, hence no
tenant context to lean on.

| Piece | Runs in | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| Assignment rules (`decideAssignment`) | API, synchronously on create | The response should already show who got the ticket |
| SLA apply / pause / resume | API, synchronously | Due dates belong on the created ticket, and the clock must stop the moment a pausing status is chosen |
| Blueprint checks (`checkTransition`) | API, synchronously | A refused move needs an immediate, specific error |
| Automation and escalation rules (`runTrigger`) | Worker, `automation` queue | A slow rule or a flaky email must never delay a request |
| SLA sweep (`scanSla`) | Worker, repeatable `sla` job | Warnings and breaches fire whether or not anyone is using the app |

The sweep is idempotent: each target is stamped (`*WarnedAt`, `*BreachedAt`) the first
time it fires, so a retried job or a second worker cannot fire it twice. Triggers are
enqueued with a per-second job id, so a burst of edits to one ticket collapses into one
evaluation rather than storming the rules.

Business-hours arithmetic uses `Intl` alone: working windows live in the calendar's
timezone and are converted per day, so DST shifts and holidays are honoured without a
date library.

## 5c. The customer portal

One Next.js route group, `app/(portal)/help/[slug]`, serves every organization's help
center; the slug in the URL is what decides which one. On the API side that address is
resolved by `PortalContextMiddleware`, which looks the help center up (cached in Redis
for 30 seconds, dropped the moment settings change) and opens the tenant scope for
visitors who have no token to open one with. `PortalGuard` then does the rest in one
place: the site must exist and be published, a bearer token must belong to the same
organization as the site (a token from another tenant is refused, never ignored), and
the site's own switches decide whether an anonymous visitor may read anything at all.

Portal routes are `@Public()` to the platform guard and resolve the visitor themselves,
which keeps anonymous and signed-in access on one code path.

**A portal visitor is a `User` of type `CUSTOMER`** linked to their `Contact`, not a
second kind of account: sessions, refresh rotation, password rules and reset links are
the ones the agent app already uses. Record visibility is narrowed before permissions
are consulted — `ticketVisibilityFilter` gives a customer their own requests and nothing
else, whatever a role grants — and the portal serves its own ticket projection, so an
internal comment is excluded by the query rather than filtered out afterwards.

**Every channel creates tickets through one path.** `TicketsService.createTicket` owns
the ticket number, the audit entry, assignment routing, the SLA clock and the
`TICKET_CREATED` trigger; the agent UI, the portal and web forms all hand over to it, so
a customer's request is routed and measured exactly like an agent's. A customer reply
arrives as an inbound message authored by the contact, reopens a request that had been
resolved, and fires `CUSTOMER_REPLIED` for automation to act on.

## 5d. The channel pipeline

`packages/channels` holds the adapters and knows nothing about tickets: each one
verifies a provider's signature over the raw request bytes, parses its payload into a
common `InboundMessage`, and — where the provider supports it — sends. That keeps
protocol quirks (Mailgun's timestamped HMAC, Meta's `hub.challenge`, Twilio's
URL-plus-parameters signature) in one small, unit-tested place.

Everything a channel must agree on lives in the API's ingestion service instead:

1. **Dedupe first.** The delivery is written as a `ChannelEvent` keyed by the provider's
   message id; losing that insert means it is a redelivery, and nothing else runs.
2. **Ignore machines.** Auto-replies, bounces and list mail are recorded and dropped,
   which is what stops two auto-responders from talking to each other.
3. **Identity.** A `ChannelIdentity` maps the sender to a contact, reusing a contact that
   already has that email address, and creating one only when nobody matches.
4. **Threading.** A stored message id, then the ticket number in the subject, then — for
   conversational channels — the contact's open ticket from the last day.
5. **The ticket.** New conversations go through `TicketsService.createTicket`, the same
   path the agent UI, the portal and web forms use, so routing, SLA and automation apply
   identically. Replies go through the same inbound path as the portal, so a customer
   reply reopens a resolved ticket and fires `CUSTOMER_REPLIED` whatever channel it came
   from.

Outbound is the mirror image and runs in the worker: an agent's public reply on a ticket
that arrived on a channel is queued, sent by that channel's adapter (or, for email, by
the deployment's mail provider with `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To` and `References` so the
customer's answer threads back), and the provider's id is written onto the stored
message. Live chat is delivered over Redis to the visitor's socket rather than an
external API — the same publish-and-fan-out shape, without a third party.

Credentials never leave the API: they are encrypted with AES-256-GCM under
`CHANNEL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, the REST layer returns only the *names* of the fields that
hold a value, and the worker decrypts with the same key when it sends.

## 5e. The assistant

`packages/ai` is the assistant, and like `packages/engine` it is a library the API and
the worker both call rather than a service either owns. Three layers:

- **Providers.** `AiProvider` is four methods — `summarise`, `sentiment`, `intent`,
  `suggestReply` — each returning a typed result plus token usage. `AnthropicProvider`
  calls the official SDK with one of four pinned models and a cached system prompt;
  `HeuristicProvider` is a rule-based analyser (a sentiment lexicon that understands
  negation, intent rules that map to the organization's own categories, an extractive
  summary) that runs in-process, needs no credentials and no network, and is the default
  so the feature works on a fresh install. Adding a provider means implementing the
  interface; nothing above this layer knows which one answered.
- **The data path.** `analyse.ts` loads the organization's settings, builds the provider,
  gathers the ticket context, retrieves grounding articles, enforces the budget, calls
  the provider and stores the result. It takes an unscoped Prisma client and an explicit
  `organizationId`, so the API can run it inside the tenant context and the worker can
  run it without one.
- **The surfaces.** `AiService` (API) wraps it for agent requests; `ai.processor`
  (worker) runs the same code when a ticket is created or a customer replies, if the
  organization turned auto-analysis on.

Four rules hold whichever provider is configured:

1. **Only what the customer could see leaves the server.** The context is built from
   public replies alone — an internal comment is never sent to a provider.
2. **Grounding is explicit.** A suggested reply is drafted against published knowledge
   base articles retrieved by keyword score; when nothing matches, the draft says so and
   asks for detail rather than inventing an answer, and the UI shows that it is
   ungrounded.
3. **Nothing is applied automatically.** The reply is a draft handed to the composer,
   and an intent's category and priority are applied only when an agent presses the
   button.
4. **Spend is bounded and visible.** Every call is stored with its tokens, cost and
   latency — failures included — and the monthly token budget is checked before the
   call, so it is a hard stop rather than a report after the fact.

## 5a. File storage

`packages/storage` holds `StorageProvider` and both its implementations, chosen by
`STORAGE_PROVIDER`; it moved out of the API in Phase 7 so the worker can write report
exports to the same place the API serves attachments from, with one provider
implementation instead of two copies that could drift:

- **local** — writes under `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` and streams downloads back through the
  API. Suits development and single-node self-hosting; the path is resolved once and
  every key is checked to stay inside the root.
- **s3** — any S3-compatible bucket, with downloads handed out as short-lived signed
  URLs.

Uploads are proxied through the API rather than presigned direct to the bucket. That
keeps one validation and authorization path (size, MIME allowlist, tenant, ticket
visibility) for both providers, and means the local provider is a real option rather
than a stub. Storage keys are generated server-side as
`{organizationId}/tickets/{ticketId}/{uuid}{ext}` and never derived from the uploaded
filename. A report export follows the same rule under `exports/{organizationId}/
{exportId}.csv`, written by the worker and downloaded through the API.

## 5f. Reporting and CSAT

`packages/analytics` is a third library alongside the engine and the assistant, with the
same shape: it takes an unscoped Prisma client and an explicit `organizationId`, and both
the API (inside the tenant context) and the worker (without one) call the same functions.

- **Reports read a mix of rollups and live queries.** `TicketDailyMetric` and
  `AgentDailyMetric` hold one row per organization/day/(department or agent), recomputed
  by a worker sweep (`rollupRecent`) that re-rolls the last two days on every pass — a
  ticket resolved today changes the day it was *created* on, so recent days are
  recomputed rather than appended to. Anything the rollup cannot answer without widening
  it (an agent or priority filter beyond the day/department grain) reads the ticket table
  directly with the same date-range predicate. Either path, the answer is the same;
  which one runs is an implementation detail.
- **A report is never older than two minutes.** Before answering, the API checks
  whether today's and yesterday's rollup rows are fresh (`ensureRecentRollup`) and
  recomputes them inline if not — a dashboard opened moments after a ticket closes does
  not wait for the worker's timer.
- **An export is a queued job.** `POST /reports/export` writes a `ReportExport` row and
  returns immediately; the worker renders the same report to CSV and writes it through
  `StorageProvider`, so a heavy export never blocks a request and never runs twice for
  the same row.
- **A CSAT survey is scheduled, never polled for.** `TicketsService` calls
  `CsatService.onTicketResolved` exactly once — only on the transition *into* a resolved
  status the ticket had not already reached — which writes one `CsatResponse` row and
  queues the email. The row's `tokenHash` is the only credential the public endpoints
  accept; like a password-reset token, the raw value exists solely in the email.

## 6. Non-functional commitments

- TypeScript `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, ESLint rule banning `any` (§ Rule 9).
- Controller → Service → Prisma. No Prisma calls in controllers, no business logic in React components (Rules 6, 7).
- Consistent error envelope `{ success: false, error: { code, message, details? } }` via a global exception filter; stack traces never leave the server in production (§52).
- Structured JSON logging (pino) with request id + org id + user id; a redaction list covers `password`, `token`, `authorization`, `secret` (§53).
- Every multi-step write uses `prisma.$transaction` (Rule 15).
